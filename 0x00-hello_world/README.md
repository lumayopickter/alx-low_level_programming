# Preprocessor Script

This script, "0-preprocessor.sh", is a shell script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the required permissions to execute the script.
2. Set the C file name by assigning the desired filename to the variable `CFILE` within the script.
3. Run the script by executing `./0-preprocessor.sh`.
4. The script will invoke the GCC compiler with the appropriate options to preprocess the C file and save the output in a file named "c".

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the script:

```bash
$ chmod +x 0-preprocessor.sh
$ ./0-preprocessor.sh
